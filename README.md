### This was a dificult asignment, I understandstand the concept but I am not sure the moduale provided enough preparation for this task.  The idea as I see it, is to use tickerIndex as a Silo for all the required information to complete the output calculations for each ticker. You must set the tickerIndex and totalVolume to zero to ensure it reset after each ticker to get a accurate calculation for each ticker. The code is written to check before the starting priceand after the ending price. When completing division the denominator can never be zero.  As discussed in class, unnesting and combining will make the code run faster. 

### Like the previous module, a general example of refactoring and un-nesting would prove to be helpful with this assignment.
