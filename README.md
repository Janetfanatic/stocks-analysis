### This was a dificult asignment, I understandstand the concept but I am not sure the moduale provided enough preparation for this task.  The idea as I see it, is to use tickerIndex as a Silo for all the required information to complete the output calculations for each ticker.  As discussed in class, unnesting and combining will make the code run faster. Like the previous module an general example of refactoring and un-nesting should have been provided.  Google did not provide resources to assist with this assignment.  Hopefully this will be my lowest grade in this program and it will be dropped at the end.
